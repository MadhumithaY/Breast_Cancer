## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
2. Run the code cells or script to train the model and make predictions.

## Data Source and Description
- The dataset was obtained from (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).
- It contains 570 samples with 32 features each.

## Preprocessing
- Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, feature scaling.

## Model and Algorithm
- The logistic regression model was used for binary classification.
- The algorithm was implemented using NumPy and Python.

## Results
- The model achieved an accuracy on train : 88.81987577639751 % on the test set.
- The model achieved an accuracy on test  : 93.02325581395348 % on the test set.

## Contributing
- Contributions to this project are welcome. Feel free to submit a pull request.
